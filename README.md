Hello, I have a problem with first two tests, I keep getting these errors: 
1) `You don't have funds to withdraw` eventhough bob should have 0.5 ether since I called the split() function before, right?
2) `AssertionError [ERR_ASSERTION]: The expression evaluated to a falsy value:`, which means that the split() function didn't work... 
Thank you very much for your help :)
